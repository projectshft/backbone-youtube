I need to build a Youtube App with the following functionality.
  A user should be able to search something in the search bar, and get a list of videos back, with one showing up in the main screen.
    Put in a searchbar with an id which I can listen to and use a fetch operation to grab the photos.
  When a user clicks a video in the list on the right, the main video should change to that video.
    Need to figure out how to update the view by changing the array value so that the side videos load into the primary video? 
    Need two seperate functions to load the main video and side videos. 
  Each time a user clicks a different video, the title and description beneath the main video should update as well.
    Tie the mainvideo function to array value 0. Put first 4 videos beneath the main video. 
  When the user first loads the page, there should be a default search with videos loaded so the page is not blank.
    Placeholders or just choose defaults in Backbone to populate default videos. 

I need to use the Rules of Data Flow and use backbone. I also must integrate the YT data API. 
I need one Collection (VideosCollection). 2 Models (Video Model and App Model). 2 Views (App View and Model View) Main Js to tie everything togeth along with all the NPM stuff. 
 
 
Step 1. HTML and NPM Setup
Step 2. Setup Models, Collections, and Views and Tie them together
Step 3. Integrate the API and create listener events and initalize events. 
Step 4. Profit



Things have to use:
  parse
  el
  Backbone extend method
